# PWGuard - A password vault

## Overview

PWGuard is a simple web-based password vault, using the
[Play Framework][] and [AngularJS][]. For complete documentation,
including screen shots, please see the
[wiki](https://github.com/bmc/pwguard/wiki).

## Purpose

This application serves two purposes:

1. It provides me a convenient way to save various passwords and related
   data, search for them, and access them remotely and securely (e.g., from my
   phone).

2. It's a testbed application, for both Play and AngularJS. I use Play and
   AngularJS in my consulting work, and I teach Play and AngularJS courses
   for [NewCircle](http://thenewcircle.com/). Having a well-defined and
   relatively small application that uses both technologies allows me
   to experiment with new technologies and with changes in Play and
   AngularJS, without affecting my clients.

uses many excellent open source packages. See the wiki for details.
