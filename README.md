# PWGuard - A password vault

## Overview

PWGuard is a simple web-based password vault, using an [Akka HTTP][] backend
and an [Angular 2][] front-end. For complete documentation, including screen
shots, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/bmc/pwguard/wiki).

## Purpose

This application serves two purposes:

1. It provides me a convenient way to save various passwords and related
   data, search for them, and access them remotely and securely (e.g., from my
   phone).
2. It's a testbed web application.

I use this application on a daily basis.
